## Strat
### Room Setup / Positioning
- Generally, one boss will always be out of their pod and we will steal that pod to help
  - You can only survive in the pod for 30-45 seconds
  - When you leave you will get a debuff preventing you from entering again for a time.
  - We will need to coordinate "Pod People" (sorry :-( ); Two per phase.
- Tank active boss near their pod
- Non-tanks stack loosely behind the boss

### Tanks
- Taunt after 2 stacks of [Exploit Weakness](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=244892) debuff.
- Keep the current boss pointed away from the raid.

### DPS & Healers
- Melee on back side of boss
- Range loosely spread out behind boss

### All
- Interrupt [Fanatical Pyromancer](http://www.wowhead.com/npc=127724) on [Pyroblast](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=246505) cast.

### Kill

      - Will charge 1 of the 3 furthest targets from them and then begin a [Bladestorm](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=253038)

 - [Withering Fire](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=245103)

- POD PEOPLE
  - [Felshield Emitter](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=244902)
    - Create an usable object for raiders to click on.
    - Clicking it creates a shield with a 10 yard radius which reduces all incoming fire damage by 50% for people underneath it.
