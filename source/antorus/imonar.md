### Tanks

  - 3-4 stacks

- Move away from group when targetted by [Charged Blasts](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=247716)  
  
## Abilities
  
### Phase 1
- [Shock Lance](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=247367)  
  - Increases physical damage taken by 10% per stack, also does pulsing damage to random raid member.  
  - Taunt off main tank at 3-4 stacks.  
- [Pulse Grenades](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=247376)  
  - Knock back + 50% more nature damage taken for 20s.
  - Stack at edge of platform to keep spawns controlled.  Will stay up for rest of fight.  
- [Sleep Canister](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=247552)
  - Debuff when dispelled or timed out will put player and anyone in 7 yards to sleep.  
  - Move away from group, then dispell.  
  - Will be asleep for 8s, unavoidable.  
  
### Intermission 1
- Run from platform 1 to platform 2.  
- Avoid [Pulse Grenades](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=247376) and [Statis Traps](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=247641) on bridge.
  - [Statis Traps](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=247641) stuns everyone within 3 yrds for 8s.
- When group reaches next platform (all players), interrupt [Conflagration](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=248321).  This triggers phase 2.  
  
### Phase 2
- [Sever](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=247687)
  - Big burst + 18s dot.  Taunt when debuff drops off off tank. (around 3).  
- [Shrapnel Blast](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=247949)
  - Burst damage when placed.  If stepped on, more raid damage and 30s dot to those nearby.  
  - Move as group around edge of platform to help control placement/maximize space.
- [Charged Blasts](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=247716)
  - Damage, 18s dot, and knockback to all those in a line.  
  - Move out of group when targetted.  Position so knockback doesn't push you into mines.  
  
### Intermission 2
- Traps on bridge from Intermission 1 remain.  
- [Shrapnel Blast](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=247949) added to bridge.

### Phase 3
- [Empowered Shock Lance](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=250255)  
  - Same as Phase 1, but debuff is now permanent.  
- [Empowered Pulse Grendade](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=248068)  
  - 30s debuff, damage and a knockback to anyone in 5 yrds.
