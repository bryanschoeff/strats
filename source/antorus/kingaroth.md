  - The pod you go to will shift one to-the-right each round

### Tanks
- Main tank needs to be at least 5 yards away from anyone else
- Off tank taunts when the current tank has [Forging Strike](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=254919) (as long as yours has fallen off)
- Off-tank smashes orbs away from the group

- Avoid the orb from [Diabolic Bomb](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=246779)

  - [Shattering Strike](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=248375) is cast if no one is in melee.

    - Leaves a Detonation Charge on the ground.
      - This charge is permanent
      - Pulses damage to anyone within 5 yards each time a [Reverberating Strike](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=254926) is cast.
    - Raid will need to be spread out to manage this
  - [Ruiner](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=246840)
    - After a short charge up time the boss will send out a large beam
    - Deals a huge amount of ticking damage to anyone who stands within it 
    - Will then rotate the beam (can be either direction)
    - Boss will face the direction the beam will start before it starts
  - [Diabolic Bomb](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=246779)
    - Spawns an orb at a random location
    - Orb will start to roll around the boss at a fixed distance
    - Running into an orb explodes it, dealing heavy shadow damage to the entire raid dropping off with distance.
    - Off-tank should pop these on the opposite side of the room from the raid

### Phase II (Construction)
- Boss channels [Apocalypse Protocol](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=246516) for 40 seconds
  - Boss takes 99% reduced damage
  - 3 rooms open up around the area
  - When channel completes the rooms close; if you are in them you die
- [Flames of the Forge](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=246646) - unavoidable ticking raid-wide damage
- Spawns [Apocalypse Blast](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=246634) zones
  - Green circles on the ground that explode after a few seconds
  - Damage anyone within the zone
  - Should be avoided  
- The Rooms
  - 2 rooms will have a dormant Fel Reaver with 30 stacks of [Initializing](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=246504)
    - Drops a stack per second
    - When the stacks drop the Fel Reaver becomes active
  - 3 types of Fel Reavers each with one ability
    - [Garothi Demolisher](http://www.wowhead.com/npc=127235) casts [Demolish](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=246706)
      - Debuffs a couple members of the raid
      - When it expires, it deals shadow damage split between all players nearby
      - Also leaves a debuff which increases the shadow damage you take by 100% for 4 seconds
      - Debuff lengths are different so they explosions are staggered
    - [Garothi Annihilator](http://www.wowhead.com/npc=127230) casts [Annihilation](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=246664)
      - Creates a few zones; after a short while an orb will explode on the location dealing a flat burst of damage to the entire raid
      - A player standing in the zone as it explodes takes the damage instead
      - There is no damage split, so one player per soak
    - [Garothi Decimator](http://www.wowhead.com/npc=127231) casts [Decimation](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=246686)
      - Puts a debuff on a few players
      - After the debuff times out, it spawns a large circle on the ground
      - Shortly after the circle will explode and deals a flat amount of damage to the raid
      - Deals a much larger amount of damage to anyone within the circle
    - Killing a Fel Reaver causes [Feedback Overload](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=258643)

## Heroic
- [Diabolic Bomb](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=246779) spawns 3 orbs instead of 1
- There will be 3 Fel Reavers instead of 2
- We will kill the North and East pods every time (no rotation)
  - This will leave us with the extra Fel Reaver in the order:
    - [Garothi Decimator](http://www.wowhead.com/npc=127231)
