  - When debuff expires (5 seconds), the players will drop a large circle.
  - A few moments later, these circles will explode, dealing damage to players who stand within them, as well as a small amount of damage to the raid.
- [Annihilation](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=244761) creates several zones around the room will explode afwhich ter a short time, each dealing moderate raid wide damage.
  - Players standing within the zones as they explode take the damage instead.
  - At least one person needs to soak each.

  - Does ticking damage to the group over 20 seconds which ends with a lethal burst of damage to the entire raid.
  - Must kill one of the weapons to interrupt the cast.
  - When one of the weapons is killed, that ability is removed for the remaining of the fight.  The one left is empowered.
    - Killing the Annihilator is preferred
