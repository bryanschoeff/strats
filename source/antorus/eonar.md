## Strat
### Room Setup / Positioning
- Eonar is at center of room.  Mobs will move down one of 3 paths (+ air path) to Eonar.  Upon reaching her, will damage her.  
- 3 main lanes: upper, mid, lower.  Portals will spawn add on up to 2 of these paths at once.   
- Goal: Kill adds before they reach Eonar, and collect energy they drop.  Upon reaching 100 energy, Eonar will damage Paraxis ship.  4 casts will destroy ship and win fight.
- Portal order: mid, lower, mid, top/bottom, mid, bottom (slightly after previous mid), top(bats), top, mid
  - Mini map will have indicators as well for where portals are going to spawn.


### Tanks
- Pick up Fel-Infused Destructor if part of the wave.  
- Interrupt [Artillery Strike](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=246305) to prevent Eonar from taking unnecessary damage. 

### DPS & Healers
- Use CC on adds to slow advance (snares, roots, stuns, knockbacks, etc)  
- Damage to raid will primarily be coming from Paraxis, not adds themselves.  

### All
- Use jump pads and [Surge of Life](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=245781) to move between 3 lanes.

## Abilities
### Small Adds  
- None of these adds have abilities.  But important to understand different types.  
- Fel Lords: Move slowly, but more health.  
- Felguards: Average speed, average health.  
- Fel Hounds: Move quickly, but lower health.  
- Volant Kerapteron (bats):  Average health and speed, but ignore normal walkways.  Can be killed by ranged at middle path.  

### Big Adds   
- Fel-Charged Obfuscator
  - Can't be tanked or CC'd.  Also makes nearby adds to be untargetable.  
  - Primary dps target when alive.
  - Note: small adds can still be hit by CC/damage from aoe effects.  
- Fel-Infused Destructor  
  - Needs to be tanked.  
  - Moves to a location near the portal, then becomes active.  
  - No threat generation in this time, so tanks need to be nearby to pick up this add ASAP.  
  - Interrupt [Artillery Strike](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=246305) when cast to prevent Eonar from taking unnecessary damage.  
- Paraxis  
  - Flying around overhead, not directly engagable.  
  - [Paraxis Artillery](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=246313) does small bursts of damage to raid throughout fight.  
  - [Rain of Fel](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=248326) will debuff a few players.  
    - Circle will appear around player.  Move away from rest of raid.

## Heroic
- [Spear of Doom](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=248861)  
  - Fired from Paraxis.  Follows player and leaves behind puddles.  
  - Try to place near edges of path.  Does damage to players and increases add movement speed.
- Fel-Powered Purifiers (new big add)
  - Need to be tanked. Has [Purification](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=250073) aura making all nearby adds immune to CC
  - Last dps priority.
