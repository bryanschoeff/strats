## Heroic
- Buffs in phase 1 only last for 30s instead of 60s.
- [Sweeping Scythe](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=248499) debuff is now 150% per stack instead of 75%.
- Adds in phase 3 become immune to interrupts for 20s after being interrupted.
  - Must not interrupt [Starblast](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=253061) so [Cosmic Beacon](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=252616) can be interrupted.
