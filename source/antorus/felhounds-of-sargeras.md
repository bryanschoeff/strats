order: 2

## Strat
### Room Setup / Positioning
- Position the bosses at least 40 yards appart to prevent [Sargeras' Blessing](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=246057).
- Melee should be on Shatug (Shadow Dog)
- Range want to generally stay lightly grouped up between the two bosses.
- Shared health pool; range who benefit from multi-dotting have an advantage here and should exploit it to the fullest.

### Tanks
- There are no taunts, you will need to deal with the stacking debuff's from your respective hound.  Keep in mind these _will_ fall off periodically based on your hound casting certain abilities.
- [Burning Maw](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=254747)/[Corrupting Maw](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=254760) is your big incoming damage mechanic.

### DPS & Healers
- Move [Desolate Gaze](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=244768) out of the group; be cognizant of the melee and tanks so your line does not hit them as well.
- Run [Enflamed](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=248815) out of the group.
- Move away from [Consuming Sphere](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=244131) the further the better since it is a _gravity_ mechanic.
- Try to keep [Siphoned](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=248819) from overlapping if you have it.  If you don't help soak them.

## Abilities
### Shared
- Both hounds gain [Sargeras' Blessing](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=246057) when they are within 40 yards of each other
- [Focusing Power]() temporarily suspends a Felhound's power generation.  This just affects the timing of the encounter, it is not something that has to actively be dealt with.

### F'harg (Fire Dog)
- [Burning Maw](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=254747) - deals a large burst of damage to the tank which also buffs the dog with [Smouldering](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=251445), causing their next few melee attacks to apply a large DoT to all players in a cone in font.
- [Desolate Gaze](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=244768) (at 33% energy)
  - Marks multiple members of the raid. After a few seconds he will deal damage in a line, towards the marked players.
  - Marked players need to make sure that there is nobody between them and F'harg (spread the lines to the outside).
- [Enflame Corruption](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=244057) (at 100% energy)
  - Deals moderate ticking damage to the raid over 9 seconds
  - Periodically debuffs people with [Enflamed](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=248815)
    - Causes the player to explode after 4 seconds (run it out).

### Shatug (Shadow Dog)
- [Corrupting Maw](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=254760) - deals a large burst of damage to the tank which also buffs the dog, causing their next few melee attacks to apply a large DoT to all players in a cone in font.
- [Consuming Sphere](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=244131) (at 33% energy)
  - Shoots an orb toward a random range player
  - The orb will pull in all players
  - The further away you are from the orb, the weaker the pull in.
  - Contact with the orb causes ever increasing ticking damage until you leave it.
- [Siphon Corruption](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=244056) (at 100% energy)
  - Deals moderate ticking damage to the raid over 9 seconds
  - Periodically debuffs people with [Siphoned](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=248819)
    - All players within 8 yards of the affected person will split the damage

## Heroic
### Shatug (shadow)
- Will debuff several people with [Weight of Darkness](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=244071)
  - At 66% energy
  - 5 second debuff 
  - Slows over its duration
  - When it expires, fears the target and anyone within 8 yards for 20 seconds
    - Fear duration is split
    - If 2 other players soak it, the fear does not happen

### F'harg (fire)
- Casts [Molten Touch](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=244086)
  - At 66% energy
  - Picks up a few people and stun them for 1.8 seconds
    - They are suspended in the air
    - Shoot fire circles at other players (need to be avoided)
- Both hounds have 66% energy abilities; I will add these to the strat later

## Mythic
- Ask Randy

## Notes
- Moved Mike primarily to Fire dog due to the common occurrence of that tank being hit with the fear (and his ability to immune it)
